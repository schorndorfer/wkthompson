# Entity Linking

Entity linking is the task of identifying and linking mentions of entities in text to their corresponding entries in a knowledge base. This process involves two main steps: named entity recognition (NER) to identify the entities in the text, and disambiguation to link these entities to the correct entries in the knowledge base.
