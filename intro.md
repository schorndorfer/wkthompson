## Introduction
This online book is my attempt to keep track and provide structure to my thoughts on various topics. It is a work in progress and will be updated as I learn more.

The book is written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language that allows for easy formatting of text. The book is built using Jupyter Book, a tool that allows for the creation of interactive books and documents using Jupyter notebooks and Markdown.
The book is hosted on GitHub, a platform for version control and collaboration.

## My Background
I am a software engineer with a background in computational linguistics and a passion for learning. I have experience in various programming languages and frameworks, and I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to learn new skills.

I have a Ph.D. from Northwestern University in Linguistics, where I studied the syntax and semantics of natural language. My dissertation focused a game-theorectic approach to turn-taking in conversation. I have also worked as a researcher at the Motoral Labs, and at Northwestern's Feinberg School of Medicine. I'm currently the Lead Computational Research Consultant at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management, where I work on various projects related to data science and machine learning.
