## Introduction
This online book is my attempt to keep track and provide structure to my thoughts on various topics related to computational linguistics. It is a work in progress and will be updated as I learn more.


## My Background
I am a computational linguist with a passion for learning. I have experience in various programming languages and frameworks, and I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to learn new skills.

I have a Ph.D. from Northwestern University in Linguistics, where I studied the syntax and semantics of natural language. My dissertation focused a game-theorectic approach to turn-taking in conversation. I have also worked as a researcher at the Motorola Labs, and at Northwestern's Feinberg School of Medicine.
